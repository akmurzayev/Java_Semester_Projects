# Java Semester Projects

This repository contains my Java projects for the semester.

## Task 1
In Task 1, I created a basic Java Spring project.  
I learned how to create controllers, services, and basic REST endpoints.  
This task helped me understand the project structure and Spring Boot basics.

## Task 2
In Task 2, I created a REST API using Spring Boot.  
I implemented CRUD operations for products (create, read, update).  
I also added an H2 in-memory database and used JPA Repository.  
Swagger was used to test and document the API.
